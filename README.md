# Question: How would you implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. The LRU cache is a type of cache in which the least recently used entries are removed when the cache reaches its capacity. The code defines a class `LRUCache` with two generic types, `TKey` and `TValue`, representing the key and value of the cache items respectively. The class uses a `Dictionary` and a `LinkedList` to store the cache items and manage their order of use. The `Dictionary` provides fast access to the cache items, while the `LinkedList` maintains the order of use. When a new item is added to the cache and the cache is full, the least recently used item (the first item in the `LinkedList`) is removed from both the `Dictionary` and the `LinkedList`. When an item is retrieved from the cache using the `Get` method, it is moved to the end of the `LinkedList` to indicate that it is the most recently used item. If the item is not found in the cache, the `Get` method returns the default value for the type `TValue`. This implementation ensures that the most recently used items are kept in the cache while the least recently used items are evicted when the cache is full.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the LRU Cache implementation uses the built-in OrderedDict from the collections module, which maintains the order of the elements based on their insertion order. This feature is used to keep track of the order of use of the keys. When a key is accessed, it is moved to the end of the OrderedDict using the move_to_end method, indicating that it is the most recently used key. When the cache reaches its capacity, the least recently used key (the first key in the OrderedDict) is removed using the popitem method with the last parameter set to False.

On the other hand, the C# version uses a combination of a Dictionary and a LinkedList to implement the LRU Cache. The Dictionary is used for quick access to the keys, and the LinkedList is used to maintain the order of use of the keys. When a key is accessed, the corresponding node is removed from the LinkedList and added back at the end, indicating that it is the most recently used key. When the cache reaches its capacity, the first node of the LinkedList (the least recently used key) is removed, and its key is also removed from the Dictionary.

The main difference between the two implementations is the data structures used. Python's OrderedDict simplifies the implementation by combining the features of a dictionary and a linked list into one data structure, while in C#, these two data structures have to be used separately. Also, Python uses the -1 value to indicate a key not found in the cache, while C# uses the default value of the TValue type.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the LRU cache uses a LinkedHashMap to store the cache items. The LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order of the elements, which makes it suitable for implementing an LRU cache. The removeEldestEntry method is overridden to remove the oldest entry when the size of the cache exceeds the capacity. This is different from the C# version, which uses a Dictionary and a LinkedList to store the cache items and manually removes the least recently used item when the cache is full.

In the Java version, the get, put, remove, and size methods are synchronized to make the cache thread-safe. This is not the case in the C# version, which does not use any synchronization mechanisms.

The Java version also includes a remove method, which is not present in the C# version. This method removes an item from the cache given its key.

In terms of usage, the Java version uses the put method to add items to the cache, while the C# version uses the Add method. The get method is used to retrieve items from the cache in both versions.

In the C# version, the Get method returns the default value of the type TValue if the key is not found in the cache. In the Java version, the get method returns null if the key is not found.

In the C# version, a CacheItem class is used to store the key-value pairs in the LinkedList. In the Java version, the key-value pairs are stored directly in the LinkedHashMap.

In the C# version, the capacity of the cache is passed to the constructor of the Dictionary. In the Java version, the capacity is passed to the constructor of the LinkedHashMap, along with a load factor of 0.75 and an accessOrder parameter set to true, which causes the LinkedHashMap to behave like an LRU cache.
